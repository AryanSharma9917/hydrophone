# hydrophone

![Kubernetes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/master/docs/img/kubernetes-logo.png)

Lightweight runner for kubernetes tests. Uses the conformance image(s) released by
the kubernetes release team to either run individual tests or the entire [Conformance suite].
Design is pretty simple, it starts the conformance image as a pod in the `conformance`
namespace, waits for it to finish and then prints out the results.

### Project Goals

- **Simplified Kubernetes Testing**: Easy-to-use tool for running Kubernetes conformance tests.
- **Official Conformance Images**: Utilize official conformance images from the Kubernetes Release Team.
- **Flexible Test Execution**: Ability to run individual test, the entire Conformance Test Suite, or anything in between.

### Project Non-Goals

- **Replacing Kubernetes Testing Frameworks**: Not intended to replace existing frameworks, but to complement them.
- **Extensive Test Development**: Focus is on running existing tests, not developing new ones.
- **Broad Tool Integration**: Limited integration with third-party tools; maintains simplicity.
